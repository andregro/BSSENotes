# BSSENotes

This Repository contains my notes on the lecture Software Engineering by Prof.
Dr. Kramer.

The lecture was oriented after the book "Software Engineering" by Ian Sommerville
in revision 9.

The pattern part of the lecture was oriented after the book "Pattern-oriented
software architecture Volume 1: A system of patterns" by Frank Buschmann.

Because of copyright issues I only uploaded the notes without graphics, but if
you have a pdf version of the books available, it should be easy to include the
graphics.

There is additionaly used a wikipedia image:
